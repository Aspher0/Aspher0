# About me:
Hello, I'm Aspher.<br/>
I'm a Web Dev at first, mainly creating websites and web apps in PHP.<br/>
Lately, I've grown a passion for software dev. This github will share some of the things I make.<br/><br/>
There's a lot of things I think are cool.<br/>
I like cool things.<br/>
So I try to make those cool things.<br/>
